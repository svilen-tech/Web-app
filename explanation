The web app is created similar to other sites for vehicle business. This one is more simple, there are only two options for vehicles, cars and motors. If a user want to
add new vehicle, the user need to be logged in. On homepage is the search menu, where the user gives criteria and depending on the input, the result is different. For register and
login format, I have used Spring Security, so for example if a user want to add his vehicle forsale, he need to be logged, and from there he can see his other vehicles for sale.
